### OUR STORY

Day III Digital is a veteran-led development studio specializing in technical art, rendering, and deep learning for Unreal Engine and open-world AAA games.
<br>
<br>
As the complexity and costs of next-generation AAA game production have escalated dramatically, our mission is to empower game studios through custom tools and streamlined workflows. We help developers push creative boundaries without inflating budgets, overcome technical challenges before they become roadblocks, and consistently exceed player expectations.

### OUR VALUES

We're committed to building a team of exceptionally skilled yet collaborative developers who share our vision for long-term partnership. Our approach centers on talent retention through complete transparency and a cooperative environment where every voice carries equal weight in shaping our direction.
<br>
<br>
Our headquarters is located at edge of the Hohe Tauern, central Europe's largest national park. This stunning landscape provides both creative inspiration and exceptional photogrammetry resources for our open-world projects, while offering our team a peaceful retreat from the demands of cutting-edge game development.
