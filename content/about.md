**Day III Digital** is a **game development studio** nestled in the serene heart of the Austrian Alps. We specialize in crafting **open-world landscapes for AAA games**, and we take pride in pioneering tooling solutions that enable artists and designers to build rich, detailed worlds swiftly and with unparalleled flexibility.

With the majestic **Hohe Tauern National Park** as our backdrop and muse, inspiration is a mere glance away. Our vicinity to Austria’s loftiest peaks and Europe's largest waterfalls offers a treasure trove for photogrammetry and reference gathering across seasons.

We prioritize a **healthy work-life balance** and it's the perfect location to disconnect from the digital realm with family and friends. If you're into hiking, climbing, foraging, cycling, snow sports ([world's best ski resort](https://www.kitzski.at/en/service-info/company-info/worlds-best-ski-resort.html)), apfelstrudels, germknödels, etc ... you will not be disappointed!

**Day III Digital** was founded by **[Matthijs Janssens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthijs-janssens-23858a59/)**, a Technical Art Director who's worked on games like For Honor, Hogwarts Legacy and the Horizon franchise.
